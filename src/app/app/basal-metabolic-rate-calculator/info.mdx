## How Many Calories Do I Burn at Rest?

Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of calories your body needs to function in a resting state. BMR measures the energy required for your body to perform vital functions such as breathing, circulation, cell production, and maintaining body temperature. In other words, BMR is the minimum level of energy expenditure for your body without any physical activity.

This calculator uses the Harris-Benedict equation to calculate your basal metabolic rate. The Harris-Benedict equation is a method used to determine a person's BMR. This is the number of calories your body needs to operate at rest. This value can be used to estimate daily calorie needs while taking into account a person's activity level.
