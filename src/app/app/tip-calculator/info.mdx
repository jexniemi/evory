## How the Tip Calculator Works

The tip calculator helps you calculate the exact tip amount and evenly distribute it among all payers. Enter the bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. The calculator computes the tip amount using the formula:

**Tip = bill amount * (tip percentage / 100).**

Once the tip amount is calculated, the calculator adds it to the bill amount to get the total amount.

**Total Amount = bill amount + tip.**

The calculator then divides the total amount evenly among all payers.

Use the tip calculator to easily determine how much to tip and how much each person pays for the bill. This helps you plan your spending better and make fair payments in a group.

## How Much to Tip in the United States and Around the World?

In the United States, tipping is an important part of the dining and service culture. It is customary to leave a tip of 15-20% of the bill in restaurants. This is often expected by servers as a significant portion of their income, as they may receive a lower hourly wage. Additionally, it is common to tip hotel staff, such as bellhops and housekeeping, usually around $1-2 per service. Taxi drivers also typically receive a tip, often calculated as 10-15% of the fare.

Tipping practices vary significantly in other parts of the world. In some countries, like Japan, tipping may be seen as rude, as exceptional service is considered part of the job. In contrast, in many European countries, a service charge is often included in the bill, but it is still customary to leave an additional tip of 5-10% for good service. In countries like Thailand, leaving a small tip is a polite gesture, reflecting appreciation for good service. Understanding these cultural differences can help travelers navigate tipping practices more effectively.
