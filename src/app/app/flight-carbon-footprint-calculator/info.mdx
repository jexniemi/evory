## How is the Carbon Footprint of Flights Calculated?

The flight carbon footprint calculator helps you determine the environmental impact of your flight journey. Enter the information of the departure and arrival airport cities into the calculator. The calculator calculates the distance between these two airports using the Haversine formula, which takes into account the curvature of the Earth and provides an accurate distance in kilometers.

Next, the calculator estimates fuel consumption using an average value of about 2.5 liters of fuel per passenger-kilometer. This estimate is based on the average fuel consumption of commercial aircraft. The calculator calculates the total fuel consumption during the flight and uses this value to determine carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

One liter of aviation fuel produces about 2.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide. The calculator provides the carbon dioxide output based on fuel consumption, allowing you to find out the total emissions of your flight. With this information, you can understand the environmental impact of flying and make more informed decisions about your travel.

Use the flight carbon footprint calculator to easily find out how much carbon dioxide emissions your trip produces. This will help you plan more responsible travel methods and reduce your environmental impact.
