## How Does the Installment Calculator Work?

The installment calculator helps you determine your loan or installment's monthly payments and total costs. Enter the total amount of the loan or product, the annual interest rate, and the payment period into the calculator. The calculator calculates the monthly payment using the annuity loan formula:

**Monthly Payment = (Total Amount * Monthly Interest Rate) / (1 - (1 + Monthly Interest Rate)^-Months).**

Once the monthly payment is calculated, the calculator also provides the total costs of the loan or installment and the amount of interest. This helps you understand how much you will pay for the loan or installment in total and how much of that is interest.

The installment calculator is a useful tool for anyone looking to make smart financial decisions. You can use it for both smaller purchases and larger loans. This helps you manage your finances better and make more informed decisions.

Use the installment calculator to easily find out how much you will pay monthly and how much interest will accumulate. This will help you plan your finances more effectively and understand the impact of the loan or installment on your budget.
