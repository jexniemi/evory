## The Compound Interest Effect Explained Simply

### Basic Concept
The compound interest effect means that you earn interest not only on your original savings but also on the interest accumulated from previous years. In other words, the interest is added to the principal, so the next time interest is calculated, it’s on a larger amount. This leads to faster growth of your savings over time.

### How Does It Work in Practice?
Imagine you save €1000 in a bank account that pays 5% annual interest. At the end of the first year, you earn €50 in interest (€1000 * 0.05), so now you have €1050. The next year, you earn interest on the entire €1050, not just the original €1000. This means the interest for the second year is €52.50 (€1050 * 0.05). Thus, your savings grow a little faster than they did in the first year.

### Growth Over Time
When you continue saving for several years, the compound interest effect really starts to show. In the third year, you earn interest on €1102.50 (the amount at the end of the second year), which is €55.125. Over time, this effect strengthens, and the value of your savings grows exponentially, meaning it increases more quickly each year.

### Why Is Compound Interest Important?
Compound interest is important because it helps your savings grow faster than they would if you only earned interest on the original amount. This is especially beneficial for long-term saving goals, like retirement or funding major purchases. The longer you allow your savings to grow with compound interest, the more you benefit from this effect.

### Real-Life Example
Let’s say you start saving when you’re young, putting €1000 in a savings account that pays 5% annual interest. You don’t add any more money to the account, but you let it grow for 30 years. Thanks to the compound interest effect, your savings would be worth around €4321 at the end of 30 years. Without compound interest, if you only received €50 each year on the original amount, your savings would be just €2500.

### Summary
The compound interest effect is a powerful way to grow your savings over time. It leverages the power of time and allows your savings to grow exponentially, which means faster growth each year. This effect is one reason why it’s beneficial to start saving and investing as early as possible.
