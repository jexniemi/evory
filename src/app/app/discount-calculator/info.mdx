## How does the discount calculator work?

The discount calculator helps you determine how much money you'll save with a discount. Enter the original price and the discount percentage into the calculator. The calculator will calculate the discounted price using the formula:

**Discounted Price = Original Price * (1 - Discount Percentage / 100)**

Once the discounted price is calculated, the calculator will also display the amount you've saved. This is calculated with the formula:

**Savings = Original Price * (Discount Percentage / 100)**

This gives you an exact view of how much the discount affects the price and how much money you save.

The discount calculator is a useful tool for anyone who wants to make smart purchases and save money. You can use it for everyday shopping as well as larger purchases. This helps you manage your finances better and make more informed decisions.

Use the discount calculator to easily find out how much money you can save. This helps you plan your shopping more effectively and make the most of the best deals.
