## What are QR Codes?

QR codes are based on two-dimensional barcodes. The term "QR" stands for "Quick Response." QR codes were originally developed in Japan in 1994 by engineers at Denso Wave. They are quickly readable and can store a larger amount of information compared to traditional one-dimensional barcodes. QR codes can contain various types of data, such as URLs, text, contact information, Wi-Fi network details, and much more. They have become very popular in many applications, such as mobile payments, advertising, and information sharing.

## How Does a QR Code Work?

A QR code works by storing information in a two-dimensional grid made up of black squares on a white background. The information contained in the code can be read by a special QR code reader or a smartphone camera equipped with a QR code scanning app.

Data is stored in the QR code in a specific way that allows for quick and efficient reading. One method to achieve this is by using error correction algorithms. QR codes often include corrective bits that enable the information to be read even if the code is partially obscured or damaged.

When a QR code is scanned with a smartphone, the camera reads the code and converts it into digital information. This information is then directed to the QR code scanning app, which interprets it and presents the necessary information or action to the user, such as opening a website, saving contact details, logging into a Wi-Fi network, or performing another defined action.

In summary, a QR code works by storing information in a two-dimensional grid, which can then be read and interpreted using a special reader or smartphone.

## How to Read a QR Code with a Phone?

Open the smartphone camera app and point it at the QR code. The camera automatically recognizes the QR code and displays the identifier or asks if you want to open the link or action associated with the QR code. You can then choose to perform the action or open the link directly from the camera view.
