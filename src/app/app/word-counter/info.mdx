## Trivia time! What is the longest word in English language?

The longest word in English often depends on context, but here are some notable contenders:

1. **Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis** (45 letters): This is a coined term for a type of lung disease caused by inhaling very fine silica dust, typically from volcanoes or mining. It’s often recognized as one of the longest words in major English dictionaries.

2. **Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia** (36 letters): Ironically, this word refers to the fear of long words.

3. **Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious** (34 letters): Made popular by the movie *Mary Poppins*, this playful word means "extraordinarily good" or "wonderful."

4. **Methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylalanyl...isoleucine** (189,819 letters): This is the full chemical name for the protein *titin*, a complex protein in the human body. It's so long that it would take hours to say, so it’s typically shortened to "titin."

In everyday use, *pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis* is the most commonly accepted "longest word," while *titin*’s chemical name is technically the longest known scientific term.
